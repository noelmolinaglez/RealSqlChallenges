##YEAR OVER YEAR COMPARISONS

An executive requests data concerning fiscal quarter sales by salesperson. Sheâ€™d
like to see comparisons from the fiscal quarters of 2008 to the same fiscal
quarters of 2007.

For example, suppose sales for salesperson X totaled $1,000 during Fiscal Year
2008, Fiscal Quarter 2. If sales for salesperson X totaled $900 in Fiscal Year
2007, Fiscal Quarter 2, this reflects about 11.1% growth between the two periods
for salesperson X.
